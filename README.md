# PSBBN Art Database  
## Image Count: 5,620 / 22,586  

This is the art database for the [PSBBN Definitive English Patch](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch) project. When the game installer is used, all artwork downloaded from IGN is automatically contributed then uploaded here. Missing artwork is also reported and added to the `missing-art-matter.log`. The goal of this database is to reduce our reliance on IGN for artwork and eventually eliminate it entirely.  

## How You Can Help  

### Submitting Missing Artwork to the Database  
If you’d like to help by submitting missing artwork, you can do so by opening an issue on this GitHub page and including the artwork you wish to contribute.  

Contributed artwork can be in any image format. There are just three requirements:  
1. You must provide the Game ID for all contributed artwork, e.g., `SLUS_215.48`.  
2. Images must be square.  
3. Images must be 256×256 or higher in resolution.  

### Contribute via Ko-Fi  
The automatic contribution of artwork and the reporting of missing artwork require the use of [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/). I currently use a free account, which provides a URL for seven days or 100 requests. As popularity grows, we’re now exceeding the 100-request limit every few days.  

A paid subscription costs $9/month or $90/year. Donations would allow me to fund this. If you appreciate my work and want to support the continued development of the PSBBN Definitive English Patch and other PS2-related projects, [you can donate to my Ko-Fi here](https://ko-fi.com/cosmicscale).
